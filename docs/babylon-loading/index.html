    <p>
        Babylon.js supports consumption as <a href="https://doc.babylonjs.com/features/es6_support">ES6 modules</a>
        There are two flavors of using Babylon.js as an ES6 module. Because Babylon.js uses bare import modules, either
        a bundler or special server is required. That's why this demo is separate from the rest of the documentation.
        It's intended to be run from the babylon-scene repo itself where both <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@babylonjs/core">@babyloncore</a>
        and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/es-dev-server">es-dev-server</a> are installed.
    </p>

    <p>
        To run these demos, use <strong>npm run dev</strong> from the &lt;babylon-scene&gt; project root
    </p>

    <p>
        The first way of consuming Babylon.js as a module is to consume the entire library as a single module.
        Babylon.js calls this "legacy" as per their documentation.

    <p>
        More complex because importing each individual part of Babylon.js that you use is required,
        non-legacy is more in the spirit of ES6 modules because you only use exactly the modules you need
